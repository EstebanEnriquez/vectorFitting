# Fast-Relaxed Vector fitting

<p align="justify">
One of the most utilized rational approximation techniques is Vector Fitting (VF). VF approximates a frequency response using a rational function approximation, as shown in (1).

where <i>f(s)<i> may represent the transfer function or the frequency response of a system, <i>c<sub>n</sub><i> and <i>a<sub>n</sub><i> represent the sets of residues and poles, respectively. Since the solution of <i>(1)<i> is also a nonlinear problem, VF solves the problem as a linear problem in a two-stage procedure involving pole identification and residues calculation.
