# Fast-Relaxed Vector fitting

<p align="justify">
One of the most utilized rational approximation techniques is Vector Fitting (VF). VF approximates a frequency response using a rational function approximation, as shown in (1).

<p align="justify">
where *f(s)* may represent the transfer function or the frequency response of a system, *c<sub>n</sub>* and *a<sub>n</sub>* represent the sets of residues and poles, respectively. Since the solution of *(1)* is also a nonlinear problem, VF solves the problem as a linear problem in a two-stage procedure involving pole identification and residues calculation.
